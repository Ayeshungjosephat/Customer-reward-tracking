# ðŸª™ Customer Reward Analytics Report

A SQL-based analytics report designed to track and monitor users' gold coin earnings and usage across the platform.

## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

This project is a **Gold Coin Loyalty Analytics Report**, developed to track and analyze how users earn and use digital loyalty coins (Gold Coins) through various platform activities. The objective is to provide transparency into coin-related transactions, uncover user engagement trends, and assess the impact of reward-based incentives on customer behavior.

By leveraging SQL to join earnings, usage, and transaction records, this analysis captures not only the raw coin activity, but also:

- The running **balance** of Gold Coins per user at every point in time  
- The **total earned** and **used coins** from the beginning of each userâ€™s journey  
- **Usage behavior** by activity type and transaction  
- Insights into which activities drive the most engagement and value for both the business and the user  

This report can be integrated into dashboards (e.g., **Metabase**, **Power BI**) to support real-time monitoring or used offline for deep-dive audits and strategic planning.
